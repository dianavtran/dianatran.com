title: (Time) Travel Documents Enclosed
---

I received an email the other day informing me that I had received some snail mail at [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) where I was a fellow in 2012. The return address was labeled: 

>	Dro Danvers
>
>	Chronology Dept
>
>	Woonsocket, RI 02895

It was strange enough to receive a small yellow envelope from someone I didn't know but the weirdest part was the writing on the back that read "Travel Documents Enclosed." I immediately had my suspicions.

It took me a few days to make it to Code for America to pick up my mysterious mail. <br><br>

<br>At first, it was all nonsense. Upon closer inspection however, it became clear that my initial suspicions were correct.

<br>I'm guessing the image of the prehistoric water creature and submarine is a jab at my slightly irrational fear of the things that live in the ocean. I dig the mention of Texas, even if it is underwater. The two pieces that really gave away the sender's identity were the "Marker Felt" typeface and Navajo translation sheet.

At some point, I used Google Goggles to reverse image search some of the pages. It was a nice touch to "wrap" all the pages with the [Voynich Manuscript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript), a book that has never been deciphered. That was the moment I realized that I had been epically trolled.

<br>Nick ([@mapmeld](http://twitter.com/mapmeld)), well done. This means war.
